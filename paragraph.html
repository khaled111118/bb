  Grab your pack and gather your camping essentials for Loggerhead Marinelife  
 nter’s Annual Hike2O. The three-day, 2-night backcountry benefit will 
  be held Friday, March 5th, 2021 - Sunday, March 7th, 2021,
  where participants will join trail experts from the Florida
   Trail Association – Loxahatchee Chapter and Loggerhead     Marinelife Center staff biologists as they are guided
   through some of the most iconic ecosystems of South Florida.   Hike2O is not an easy undertaking,
   campsites are primitive and trail conditions and weather
    can make the hike challenging. Prior backpacking experience 
   especially in Florida is strongly recommended before attempting
   Hike2O. Those without prior backpacking experience are encouraged
     to participate in a Hike2O Virtual Day Hike anytime over
    the main event weekend. This is an excellent option for
    individuals to still support Loggerhead Marinelife Center’s
  marine educational outreach efforts and still receive the
  Hike2O event participation t-shirt, certificate of completion
    and virtual finishers award.
